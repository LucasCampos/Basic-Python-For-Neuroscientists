What is it?
-----------

This is a very hands-on course on Python. We aim at the bachelor-level
student, who is having the first contact with Python.

This course is divided into several steps:

01. Basic Python.
Here, you will learn how to use the very basic parts of Python. Numbers,
operators, basic data structures.
02. Auxiliary Libraries.
Libraries for numerical computing (Numpy) and plotting (Matplotlib) are introduced,
and their basic usage.
03. Input/Output.
How to get data in and out of your code. You will learn how to use plain text
files, npz files and excel files.
04. Extras Miscellaneous information on useful tasks. Currently contains
  * Timing a process
  * Data fitting

Requirements
------------

We make extensive use of Jupyter notebooks. You will also need the following Python
libraries installed

- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

All of these can be download as a bundle in the [anaconda
distribution.](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

Directories
-----------

- Problems This contains the problems, with comments for students to complete
to get the systems up and running.
- Solutions Contains the solutions to the problems, with the completed code
running.
